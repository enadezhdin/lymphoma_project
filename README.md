# DLBCL lymphoma_project
This is a project dedicated to development, training and validation of Personalised predictive model for DLBCL (Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) patients. The model based on the [Cox proportional hazards model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_model), and allows to determine and evaluate primary covariates that have the major influence on patients predicted survival (OS). The model was trained on the dataset from the following publication: [**Targeted sequencing in DLBCL, molecular subtypes, and outcomes: a Haematological Malignancy Research Network report**, SE Lacy et al., Blood 2020 May 14;135(20):1759-1771](https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/135/20/1759/452715/Targeted-sequencing-in-DLBCL-molecular-subtypes)
